<p>There are two IDE's I will be using in this coarse. One of them costs $13.99 CAD but it will let you make a lot of the things that we will be making throughout this coarse. That app is Continuous C# and F# IDE for iPad, you can download it by clicking <a href="https://appsto.re/ca/cf6rbb.i">here</a>. The Second IDE we will be using is called SoloLearn C#, it is a free app but you will not be able to do as many of the programs we will be doing in this coarse. You can download it by clicking <a href="https://appsto.re/ca/9ebBbb.i">here</a>.</p>
